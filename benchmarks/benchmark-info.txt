This benchmark uses the 4-dimensional Rastrigin function as a benchmark for evaluating optimization algorithms.
The Rastrigin function is a standard non-convex test function with many regularly distributed local minima,
making it suitable for assessing global optimization performance.

The function is defined on four continuous variables with typical bounds of [-5.12, 5.12].
It has a known global minimum at x = (0, 0, 0, 0), where the function value is zero.

Toolbox using well placement module to solve the problem:
 x[0] = well X1 wellhead x
 x[1] = well X1 wellhead y
 x[2] = well X2 wellhead x
 x[3] = well X2 wellhead y
