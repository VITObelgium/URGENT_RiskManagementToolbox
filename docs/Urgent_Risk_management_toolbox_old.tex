	\section{Introduction}

	\section{Features}
	\subsection{Point}
	\texttt{Point} is a representation of a single position along X, Y and Z axes in the coordinate system.
	\subsection{TrajectoryPoint}
	\texttt{TrajectoryPoint} is a representation of a \textit{Point} extended by information about \textit{md} being measured distance from wellhead to the trajectory point.
	\subsection{Trajectory}
	\texttt{Trajectory} is a class used to keep information about well bore coordinates.
	The class is a collection of \textit{TrajectoryPoint} class instances.
	\subsection{Perforation}
	\texttt{Perforation} contains collection of perforated points within a single trajectory. The class also provides information about md range of the perforated part of a well, stored in \textit{PerforationRange} object.
	\subsection{Well}
	\texttt{Well} is a comprehensive representation of the wellbore. It contains well's name, the trajectory, and the \textit{Completion} which stores additional information e.g. perforations.
	\subsection{LinearWellSection}
	\texttt{LinearWellSection} is a class representation of well bore straight sections. Linear sections of the well model are specified by following parameters:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item  \colorbox{gray!20}{md:} \texttt{float} - the measured distance over the well section.
		\item  \colorbox{gray!20}{user\_inclination:} \texttt{float} - (optional) the initial inclination of the well section with regard to the horizontal axis (in 2D setting). If none is provided, initial inclination is based on a preceding trajectory. If the section is the first in the well model and no user\_inclination was provided, initial inclination is assumed as zero.
	\end{itemize}

		\begin{description}
			\item arguments
			\begin{itemize}
				\item trajectory: \texttt{Trajectory} - trajectory to which we want to append our well section.
				\item md\_step: \texttt{float} - the sample distance over the section's md. The parameter defines precision of the constructed well section discrete model.
			\end{itemize}
			\item returns
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \texttt{Trajectory} - trajectory after appending to it well section.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{description}
	\end{description}
	\subsubsection{Math}
	The well model is located in the xz plane as shown on the picture below (note that the z-axis is defined upside down). The LinearWellSection is s fragment of a straight line. Inclination $(\theta)$ is defined as an angle between z-axis and the section. Its values can vary from $-180\degree$ to $180\degree$.

		\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{images/well_builder/linear\_section.png}
		\caption{Illustrative drawing of the linear section.}
		\label{linear_section}
	\end{figure}
	The section always starts at the last point in the trajectory (here the coordinate system is centered at that point). If $\theta$ is not provided it is calculated from coordinates of last two points form the trajectory as, such that the section is parallel to the line spanned by these points:
	\begin{equation}
		\theta = \mathrm{atan}\left(\frac{x_{-1} - x_{-2}}{z_{-1} - z_{-2}}\right)
	\end{equation}
	If $z_{-1} - z_{-2} >= 0$, and:
	\begin{equation}
		\theta = \pi + \mathrm{atan}\left(\frac{x_{-1} - x_{-2}}{z_{-1} - z_{-2}}\right)
	\end{equation}
	If the results turns out to be outside of $[-180\degree, 180\degree]$ it needs to be rotated by $-360\degree$.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $(x_{-1}, z_{-1})$ - coordinates of the last point
		\item $(x_{-2}, z_{-2})$ - coordinates of the second last point
	\end{itemize}
	\subsection{CurvedWellSection}
	\texttt{CurvedWellSection} is a class representation of well bore curvilinear sections with constant change of angle; constant dls. Curved sections of the well model are specified by following parameters:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item  \colorbox{gray!20}{md:} \texttt{float} - the measured distance over the well section.
		\item  \colorbox{gray!20}{dls:} \texttt{float} - dogleg severity.
		\item  \colorbox{gray!20}{user\_inclination:} \texttt{float} - (optional) the initial inclination of the well section with regard to the horizontal axis (in 2D setting). If none is provided, initial inclination is based on a preceding trajectory. If the section is the first in the well model and no user\_inclination was provided, initial inclination is assumed as zero.
	\end{itemize}
	\subsubsection{Methods}
	\begin{description}
		\item[\colorbox{gray!20}{append\_to\_trajectory}] \hfill
		\begin{description}
			\item arguments
			\begin{itemize}
				\item trajectory: \texttt{Trajectory} - trajectory to which we want to append our well section.
				\item md\_step: \texttt{float} - the sample distance over the section's md. The parameter defines precision of the constructed well section discrete model.
			\end{itemize}
			\item returns
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \texttt{Trajectory} - trajectory after appending to it well section.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{description}
	\end{description}
	\subsubsection{Math}
	The curved section is an arc of a circle. It is more complicated than the linear section as in general there are 8 cases. On the picture below the curved sections are shown as starting at the ends of linear sections which are in the trajectory before them. The linear section starting at point (0, 0) is located in one of four quadrants of the coordinate system. In each of these cases the curved segment can curve in 2 directions (clockwise or counter-clockwise). All the cases are shown on the picture below.
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{images/well_builder/curved\_section.png}
		\caption{Illustrative drawing of the curved section cases.}
		\label{curved_section}
	\end{figure}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item red rods - start points of the curved sections
		\item blue dots - centers of the circles
		\item $\theta$ - inclination
		\item arrows - show direction of curvature
		\item sign of $dls$ encodes information if the start point of the section is on the lower or the upper part of the circle.\\
		$dls > 0$ - start point is on the lower part\\
		$dls < 0$ - start point is on the upper part\\
	\end{itemize}
	In this case inclination is interpreted as the angle between z-axis and the straight line tangent to the trajectory at the start point. If not given it is calculated the same way as it was described in the LinearWellSection. Absolute value of dls is the angle change in degrees over 30 meters of measured distance.\newline

	\newpage
	To determine the trajectory several quantities need to be calculated. These are:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Circle radius
		\item Angle increase - absolute value of the angular coordinate change in polar coordinates centered on the circle center
		\item Circle center location
		\item Starting point - angular coordinate in polar coordinates centered on the circle center
	\end{itemize}
	Radius is calculated as:
	\begin{equation}
		R = \left|\frac{30} {dls}\right|
	\end{equation}
	where $dls$ is given in radians.\newline
	Angle increase is calculated as:
	\begin{equation}
		\Delta \phi = \frac{md}{R}
	\end{equation}
	Circle center's location is calculated as:
	\begin{equation}
		x_0 = x + sign_x \cdot R \cdot \mathrm{cos}(\theta)
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation}
		z_0 = z + sign_z \cdot R \cdot \mathrm{sin}(\theta)
	\end{equation}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $(x_0, z_0)$ - location of the center
		\item $(x, z)$ - location of the starting point
	\end{itemize}
	$sign_x$ and $sign_z$ values are determined by the particular case:

	\begin{itemize}
		\item $sign_x$ = 1 if ($dls >=0$ and $\alpha >= 0$) or ($dls < 0$ and $\alpha < 0$), = -1 otherwise
		\item $sign_z$ = -1 if ($dls >= 0$), = 1 otherwise
	\end{itemize}


	To calculate the angular location of the starting point we introduce parameters:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $r_x = x - x_0$
		\item $r_z = z - z_0$
	\end{itemize}
	They cannot both be zero as it would mean that the center is in the wellbore.\newline
	The boundary case is $rx=0$. It appears when $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}$ or $\theta = -\frac{\pi}{2}$. It has subcases:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $r_x=0$, $r_z<0$: $\phi_{start} = \frac{\pi}{2}$
		\item $r_x=0$, $r_z>0$, $\theta>=0$: $\phi_{start} = -\frac{\pi}{2}$
		\item $r_x=0$, $r_z>0$, $\theta>=0$: $\phi_{start} = \frac{3\pi}{2}$
	\end{itemize}
	$-\frac{\pi}{2}$ and $\frac{3\pi}{2}$ are technically equal. They are treated here separately for computational convenience. To the first one angle increase will be added and from the second one substracted.\newline
	Now we will consider the rest of the cases:
	 \begin{itemize}
	 	\item $r_x>0$, $r_z>0$: $\phi_{start} = -\mathrm{atan}\left(\frac{r_z}{r_x}\right)$
	 	\item $r_x<0$, $r_z<0$: $\phi_{start} = \pi-\mathrm{atan}\left(\frac{r_z}{r_x}\right)$
	 	\item $r_x>0$, $r_z<0$: $\phi_{start} = \mathrm{atan}\left(\frac{r_z}{r_x}\right)$
	 	\item $r_x<0$, $r_z>0$: $\phi_{start} = \pi + \mathrm{atan}\left(\frac{r_z}{r_x}\right)$
	 \end{itemize}

\subsection{WellManagementService}

The \textit{WellManagementService} is a high-level interface designed for creating multiple wells simultaneously. Its structure allows seamless integration with the API.
The service loads wells from a JSON configuration file, constructs them, and returns a \textit{WellManagementServiceResult} model, which can easily be serialized into a JSON file or a Python dictionary object. The class supports well shapes of types I, J, and S. Additionally, perforations can be defined for each well.\\\\
\textbf{Workflow}\\
The workflow of the \textit{WellManagementService} begins with providing a configuration file. After validating the configuration, the service initializes a \textit{WellBuilder} object for each well, passing all necessary parameters such as the well's name, sections, perforations, azimuth, and wellhead location.
The \textit{WellBuilder} starts by creating an empty \textit{Trajectory} object. It then iteratively extends the trajectory by adding discretized sections one by one.\\\\
\textit{Note: The initial well trajectory is two-dimensional. The Y-coordinate for every \textit{TrajectoryPoint} is set to zero, and the wellhead of the trajectory is positioned at the origin of the coordinate system. These assumptions simplify well building process.}\\\\
Once all sections have been discretized, the trajectory is rotated to match the configured azimuth. Afterward, the rotated trajectory is translated to the desired location.\\
Each \textit{WellBuilder} instance returns a \textit{Well} object, which includes the trajectory and all perforations assigned to the well. The \textit{WellManagementService} collects all \textit{Well} objects and transforms them into a \textit{WellManagementServiceResult}.\\
To better illustrate this process, the following figure is provided:\\

	\subsection{Logger}

	\subsubsection{Configuration}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item To configure logger in the `main.py` or `runner.py` instantiate root logger and config:
		\begin{lstlisting}
import logging
from src.logger.u_logger import configure_logger

if __name__ == "__main__":
configure_logger()
logger = logging.getLogger()
		\end{lstlisting}
	\end{itemize}

	\subsubsection{Usage}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item To use logger, simply import \colorbox{gray!20}{get\_logger} function and use accordingly:
		\begin{lstlisting}
from src.logger.u_logger import get_logger
self.logger = get_logger(__name__)
self.logger.debug("Debug message from some_module.")
self.logger.info("Info message from some_module.")
		\end{lstlisting}
	\end{itemize}

	\subsubsection{Important Note}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Add name when calling \colorbox{gray!20}{get\_logger()}, otherwise the root logger will be called, which results in logging only warning (and higher) messages and disrupts the logger hierarchy!
		\item In pytest other .log file will be created called \colorbox{gray!20}{pytest\_log.log} file.
		\item Check \colorbox{gray!20}{pyproject.toml} file if you want to log to console or create log files with names assigned as current datetime.
		\item \colorbox{gray!20}{logging.conf} is needed to keep readability of code - if logging config were in pyproject it would hinder the readability of both files.
	\end{itemize}
